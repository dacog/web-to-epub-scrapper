## http://gravitytales.com to ebook (epub)
Extract chapter and content from http://gravitytales.com and creates an epub (which can be converted to mobi file) for any web novel

#Why?

I found this novel http://gravitytales.com/novel/king-of-gods and loved it. I tried to read it on the website but my iPad Mini it's a bit old and kept crashing. I wanted to read it on my kindle (more battery time, better for the eyes) but couldn't find an ebook version of the novel. I found it easier to create this Jupiter Notebook than to keep reading from the website (don't get me wrong, the website is great, but not for my iPad Mini 1.

#How

This Notebook uses ebooklib, requests-html and pillow to scrap http://gravitytales.com and create an epub file.

# Use

1. Edit the variables (# Define the web-novel you want (Variables)) section in the Notebook.
2. Run all the cells
3. Get some coffe and wait a while. The speed depends on the number of chapters. (King of Gods took a couple of minutes)
4. (optional) use https://calibre-ebook.com/ to convert to other formats (for example mobi). I used this to get the novel into my kindle.
5. **Enjoy the novel.**
